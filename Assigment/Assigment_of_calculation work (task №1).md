## Generating Permutations

### Description:
In this task, you are required to implement an algorithm that generates all permutations of the set {1, 2, ..., n}, where each subsequent permutation is formed from the previous one by performing a single transposition.

### Theoretical Background:
The problem of generating permutations has been widely studied, with its origins tracing back to the early 17th century. It was first used in the context of bell ringing in England, where permutations of the bells were used in a practice known as "change ringing." These permutations were memorized, leading to the development of early systematic methods for generating permutations. Modern computational methods have made it much faster to generate permutations, but the fundamental challenge remains that the number of permutations grows factorially, making it difficult to generate all permutations for large sets (e.g., n! grows extremely quickly with increasing n).

### Problem Statement:
Given an integer n, generate all permutations of the set {1, 2, ..., n}, where each permutation is generated by a single transposition (swap) from the previous one.

### Algorithm:
1. **Transposition**: The core of the algorithm is to generate permutations by swapping elements (transpositions) of the current permutation to create the next one.
2. **Recursive Approach**: The task can be broken down into smaller subproblems using recursion. We generate permutations of a smaller subset of the numbers, and build up to the full set.

### Pseudocode:
```
procedure B(m, i);
begin
    if (m mod 2 = 0) and (m > 2) then
        if i < m - 1 then B := i
        else B := m - 2
    else B := m - 1
end; (*B*)

procedure PERM(m); (* global array P *)
begin
    if m = 1 then (* output the permutation P[1], ..., P[m] *)
        print(P[1], ..., P[n])
    else
        for i := 1 to m do
            begin 
                PERM(m - 1);
                if i < m then 
                    P[B(m, i)] := P[m]
            end
end; (*PERM*)

begin (*main program*)
    for i := 1 to n do P[i] := i;
    PERM(n)
End
```

#### Task Requirements:
1. **Implementation**: Implement the described algorithm for generating permutations using transpositions.
2. **Testing**: Ensure the program works for different values of n, and verify that it correctly outputs all permutations.
3. **Comments**: Add appropriate comments to explain the logic of the algorithm and the program flow.
4. **Formatting**: Each permutation should be printed on the same line, with elements separated by a space.

#### Additional Requirements:
- Ensure the use of proper variable names and clear code structure.
- Test the program on a range of values for n to verify correctness.
