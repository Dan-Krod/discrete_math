# Assignment: Set Operations Implementation

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to develop software to perform fundamental operations on sets, specifically union and Cartesian product. Practical implementation of these operations will deepen your understanding and provide hands-on experience with set operations in programming.

---

## Task
### Variant #2
Write a Python program to compute the following operations:

1. **Union of two sets**:
   - Combine all unique elements from two sets.

2. **Cartesian product of two sets**:
   - Generate all ordered pairs formed by combining each element of the first set with each element of the second set.

---

## Example
Here is an example demonstrating the expected output of the program:

### Input:
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
```

### Output:
```
Union of two sets: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}
Cartesian product of two sets: {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), ...}
```

---

## Expected Outcome
- A Python program that computes the union and Cartesian product of two sets.
- Properly documented and well-tested code.
- Improved understanding of set operations and their implementation in Python.
